# GitHub Action for version auto-bumping & auto-publishing

This GitHub Action intends to manage the versioning of npm packages via auto-bumping, auto-alpha-publishing & auto-releasing.

This GA allows to easily install and test npm packages as theyâ€™ll be automatically published to npm as an alpha release at the moment of creating a Pull Request on GitHub.

All consecutive commits pushed will be published aswell, handling automatically the versioning of each.
