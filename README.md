# GitHub Action for version auto-bumping & auto-publishing

This GitHub Action intends to manage the versioning of npm packages via auto-bumping, auto-alpha-publishing & auto-releasing.

This GA allows to easily install and test npm packages as theyâ€™ll be automatically published to npm as an alpha release at the moment of creating a Pull Request on GitHub.

All consecutive commits pushed will be published aswell, handling automatically the versioning of each.

## Usage

1. **On open PR** (poiting to `/master`), the GA will make sure to bump the package.json to the required version based on the label set on the PR [major, minor, patch]. In addition, the package will be published to NPM as an alpha release (-alpha.X).\*

2. **On push commit** (poiting to `/master`), the GA will make sure to bump the alpha release & publish a new version to NPM.\*

3. **On post-merge** (poiting to `/master`), the GA will publish the package as the @latest release.

\* Steps require to setup `actions/checkout@v2` using own [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in order to re-trigger workflows. If using the default `${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}`, workflows will be omitted.

The `package.json` version is always bumped accordingly to the latest published version on NPM, and for instance, it will auto-bump in the case of multiple PR's opened at the same time with the same version release type.

## Considerations

In order to keep the version properly updated, make sure to enable the "Require branches to be up to date before merging" rule on your GitHub `mater` branch.
