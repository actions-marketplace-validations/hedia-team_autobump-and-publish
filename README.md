# GitHub Action for version auto-bumping & auto-publishing

This GitHub Action intends to manage the versioning of npm packages via auto-bumping, auto-alpha-publishing & auto-releasing.

Using this GA allows to easily test npm packages as theyâ€™ll be automatically published to npm as an alpha release at the moment of creating a Pull Request on GitHub.
All consecutive commits pushed will be published too, handling automatically the versioning of each.

## Usage

1. **On open/synchronize PR** (poiting to `/master`), the GA will make sure to bump the alpha release accordingly to the label set & publish a new version to NPM.\*

2. **On post-merge** (poiting to `/master`), the GA will publish the package as the @latest release.

\* Steps require to setup `actions/checkout@v2` using own [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in order to re-trigger workflows. **If using the default `${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}`, workflows will be omitted.**

The `package.json` version is always bumped accordingly to the latest published version on NPM, and for instance, it will auto-bump in the case of multiple PR's opened at the same time with the same version release type.

## Considerations

In order to keep the version properly updated, make sure to enable the "Require branches to be up to date before merging" rule on your GitHub `mater` branch.

### Example Workflow file

#### On open/synchronize

```bash
#!/bin/bash
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

...
- uses: mstachniuk/ci-skip@v1
    with:
    commit-filter: "autobump"

- name: Autobump & Publish
    if: ${{ env.CI_SKIP == 'false' }}
    uses: hedia-team/autobump-and-publish@master
    with:
        label: ${{ toJson(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name) }}
        npm-token: ${{ env.NPM_TOKEN }}
        issue-number: ${{ github.event.number }}
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### On post merge

```bash
#!/bin/bash
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
    types: [closed]
...
...
...
- name: Autobump & Publish
    uses: hedia-team/autobump-and-publish@master
    with:
        npm-token: ${{ env.NPM_TOKEN }}
        issue-number: ${{ github.event.number }}
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        is-post-merge: true
```
